# Movie-Recommendation-System

            Abstract

Nowadays, the recommendation system has made it quite simple to locate the items we require. There are hundreds of thousands of movies that are available to watch for the viewers but seeking a good movie out of these large numbers is very time-consuming and complex process. This is where movie recommendation system comes into play it recommends a user movie based upon their interests and preferences. Our goal with this project is to reduce human work by proposing movies depending upon a person's choice. This project proposes an engine or a system that generates suggestions on the basis of information provided by users. Movies are recommended to the user depending upon their watch history ratings and feed backs and also their psychological profile. The content-based filtering method is proposed by our system. It entails creating systems based on a user's history that is things that have already been rated. We'll be using the tmdb 5000 dataset which we obtained from Kaggle.
